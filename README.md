# gonace
I am currently building things for [laget.se](https://www.laget.se). We mostly work with .NET Core (C#), Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript (including TypeScript) and CSS (including Less and SCSS).

I'm also the creator and maintainer the .NET client for [Cronitor](https://github.com/gonace/cronitor-net).
